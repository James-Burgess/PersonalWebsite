    <h2>Welcome to Jimmy B</h2>
    <p>Last updated: 01/04/2020</p>
    <p>
        Below I outline and answer 99% of the questions common to first contacts between myself and potential employers / recruitment.
        If you have any further questions, you can of course email me. at <a href="mailto:work@jimmyb.co.za">work@jimmyb.co.za</a>
    </p>

    <h3>What am I looking for?</h3>

    <p>
        Task wise, Im looking to create something that will have an impact on the outside world and to do that with a team of smart individuals.
        Language wise, if you mention python I'm sold - though I’m perfectly happy to transition to other languages and technologies if the task is right.
    </p>

    <h3>What kind of things do I want to work on?</h3>

    <p>
        I love solving the challenges that come with large scale applications that need to deal with huge chunks data.
        One of my favourite projects was building a real time dashboard, showing 20k cars positions on a map.
        Working on the pipelines and processing of the data is still on of my past times and I have many <a
            href="#">notebooks</a> that I have spun up just so I can play with some data.
    </p>

    <h3>What kind of things have I worked on professionally?</h3>

    <p>
        I started the professional side of my career working “full stack” on the Google cloud platform, using tools like python and javascript to automate workflows.
        Following that, I moved to a high paced startup where I had to wear all the hats of a development team, my work spanned from client interactions to the UI design of the webapp I was building.
        Currently, Im a part of a cross-functional team, playing the role of a ruby engineer, My days are split between meetings and development work on a global verification system.
        I can find myself adding new features, attending product meetings, speccing new systems and maintainig infrastructure on a daily basis.

    <h3>What technologies do I use on my own stuff?</h3>
    <p>
        Above all, I love python, most of my personal projects are written in python with a bit of JS involved. I have loads of raspberryPI's running all sorts of automations around the house.
        I love working with radio signals and high frequency communication.
    </p>

    <h3>My previous teams, and position within.</h3>
    <p>
        At my first role with the smart contracts, it was a two man team as part of a subproject for a small capital assets firm. I was the sole developer for the EVM side of things, and my compatriot handled the website frontend/backend. At my previous role, it was initially a five person backend team as part of a roughly twelve person dev team. As time went on, I would go on to be the mentor for all new backend devs coming in, one of two main points of contact for much of the frontend
        <-> backend day-to-day communication, and along with the two senior devs, the most heavily involved in working to improve our codebase as a whole. At my time of leaving I think we had… fifteen or sixteen devs in total.
    </p>

    <h3>What are some projects I’ve done?</h3>
    <p>
        My most recent project was a windows app to replace text in a document called popul8a. It was a quick session to help out a friend needing to automate the boring bits.
        I have also written a large app using estimote beacons and a bunch of other tools to automatically unlock a door when you get close to it. I called it OpenZFD.
        Currently, Im working on open-sourcing a boilerplate application to spin up a full stack app, Django, Vue, DRF, Redis, Celery.
    </p>

    <h3> When am I available?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm currently not actively looking for any oppertunies at the moment, but if you have something cool you would like my help with, it only takes a calendar month to get me on your payroll.
    </p>
    <h3> What is my ideal working week?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm a huge fan of working in an asynchronous team with flexible time, focusing on work done not time spent, as writing code is inherently creative and can be mentally taxing.
        Team communication is always important, Stand-ups are always useful to me and they usually follow some uninterpreted time to crush some tickets.
        Planning sessions and review of work are the only other meetings that should occur regularly.
    </p>

    <h3>What are my salary expectations?</h3>
    <p>
        I will not disclose any figures until an offer is made, or a figure is put forwards by an employer that is specific to me. For example: (x >= $salary >= z) is not concrete enough.[1]
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Recruiters are biased towards pushing whomever quotes the largest salary within some bounds of reason, for commission's sake. Employers are in an asymmetric position where they have complete information about the salary expectations of all applicants and current employees. The most sensible solution to this asymmetry for me is to be given a figure around which salary can be discussed, and that is what I will do. If you do not think this is fair or reasonable, I would ask you to imagine the inverse; you only find out how much you're going to be paying an employee once all others have been eliminated from the pool and are unrecoverable as prospects. Sounds like one of the worst hiring strategies ever! I'm a stickler for fair treatment, and so I ask to be treated fairly in salary negotiations.
